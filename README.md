# ManageXEmp
ManageXEmp uses Core Data for structured local persistence with reliable CRUD operations and unit-tested data flows. It showcases a SwiftUI-based multi-screen architecture with clear separation of concerns and seamless UIKit–SwiftUI interoperability where required. Inspired from KEKA employee management application.
